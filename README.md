# Search Local Breweries with Google Maps API
As a northern Virginia resident near the "Loudoun County ale trail", I would struggle to decide on which breweries to go to or try next because there are simply so many in the area. Searching "breweries near me" in google maps did not always return all of the available options and would often require scrolling through several pages of results to find newer or lesser known places, especially once I expanded my search radius.
# How it Works
To mitigate this problem, I used the Google "Nearby Search" API to incrementally search further away from my home to avoid the 60 item API return limit and ensure no breweries are missed during the search. I then used the Google "Directions" API to ensure the breweries are a reasonable driving distance away. Combining these results allowed me to get a comprehensive list of breweries within a reasonable driving distance that I could easily sort!
